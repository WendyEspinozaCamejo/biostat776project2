### Part 1: Fun with functions
1A. Exponential transformation 
Write a function that computes the exponential of a number using the truncated series expansion. The function should take two arguments:
x: the number to be exponentiated
k: the number of terms to be used in the series expansion beyond the constant 1. The value of k is always.
```{r}
Exp <- function(x, k){
  k <- 1:k
  sum(x^k/(factorial(k)))
}
Exp(2,5)
```

1B. Sample mean and sample standard deviation
